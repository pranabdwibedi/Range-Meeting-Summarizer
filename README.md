## Features

- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Converts spoken words in audio recordings to text.
- **Text Summarization**: Generates concise summaries from transcribed text.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for file processing and model execution.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and integrate with other applications.
